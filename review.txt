* nit: the linters aren't ordered by short codes. why is that?
* nit: not from this PR, but not all linters have a `Configuration Options` section

    looks like text in single-backticks aren't showing up as code-formatted text (see https://github.com/canonical/jenkins-job-linter/blob/b2d9b81c1eb88f058c79cbf0c8737c229e2d2938/docs/source/running.rst#standalone), but I think double-backticks should do it.
